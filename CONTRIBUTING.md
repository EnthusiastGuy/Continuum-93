# Contributing to Continuum93

We warmly welcome all contributions! Continuum93 is an open-source project, and your help—whether it's fixing bugs, improving documentation, suggesting features, or submitting new code - is highly valued.

This guide outlines the basics for getting started. This aims to be relaxed and flexible, but following these steps helps keep the project tidy for everyone.

## How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways to contribute beyond writing code:

1.  **Report Bugs:** If you find something that doesn't work as expected, file an **issue** on GitHub.
2.  **Suggest Enhancements:** Have an idea for a new feature or improvement? Open an **issue** to discuss it.
3.  **Improve Documentation:** Fix typos, clarify existing guides, or add new documentation.
4.  **Submit Code (Pull Requests):** Contribute new features, bug fixes, or refactoring improvements.

## Submitting Code Contributions (Pull Requests)

To keep the project history clean and manageable, please follow these general steps:

### 1. **Fork and Branch**
* **Fork** the repository to your own GitHub account.
* **Clone** your fork locally.
* Create a new branch for your work. Use a descriptive name like `fix/issue-123-crash` or `feat/new-argument-parser`.

    ```bash
    git checkout -b your-branch-name
    ```

### 2. **Code and Commit**
* Make your changes.
* Ensure your code follows the existing style and conventions except when it might be YOUR code that's more tidy
* and clean.
* Write **clear, concise commit messages**. A good commit message explains *what* you did and *why* you did it.

### 3. **Open a Pull Request (PR)**
* Push your branch to your fork on GitHub.
* Open a Pull Request against the **`main`** branch of the original Continuum93 repository.
* In the PR description, please include:
    * **What** your contribution does (e.g., "Adds a new command-line flag," "Fixes a crash when loading fonts").
    * **Why** this change is necessary or beneficial.
    * Reference any related issues (e.g., `Fixes #123`, `Closes #45`).

### 4. **Review and Iterate**
* I'll review your PR, and may suggest changes or ask for clarification.
* Don't worry about being perfect! I'm here to help you get your code merged.

## Bug Reports and Feature Suggestions

The best way to submit non-code contributions is by opening an **Issue** on GitHub.

### When creating an Issue, please include:

* **Bugs:** Steps to reproduce the bug, expected behavior, and actual behavior.
* **Features:** A clear description of the feature, why it would be useful, and how it might work.

**Thank you for helping to make Continuum93 better!**
